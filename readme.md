<h1>Mongoose</h1>
<p> Mongoose is used in Node.js applications to interact with MongoDB in an organized and efficient way. It provides a schema-based solution to model your data, making it easier to define the structure and relationships of your data. Without Mongoose, you'd have to write more complex code to handle MongoDB operations directly.</p>
